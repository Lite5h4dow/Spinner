current plan is to build this as a normal Next JS project for now and migrate the project to React Server Components and Next Server Streaming once it leaves alpha nd becomes more stable. it might be possible to move this on to bunjs once that is also more compatible with more of nextjs' features.

## Project Aim
making an opensource self run cloud service management platform that allows people to deploy to their own machines with the ease of something like GCP / AWS on their own hardware using the power of docker (and maybe kubernetes if i learn it ðŸ˜€)
